			Toronto has one of the liveliest music and nightlife scenes in the world. The major venues host the biggest touring acts and renowned arts producers, but those little hole-in-the-wall bars with independent musicians make for memorable experiences too. No matter what style of music gets you moving, you wonâ€™t have trouble finding a crowd of similar devotees rocking out to the hottest local and international acts in Toronto.
